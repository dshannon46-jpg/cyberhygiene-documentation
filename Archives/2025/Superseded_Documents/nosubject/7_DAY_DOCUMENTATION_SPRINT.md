# 7-DAY DOCUMENTATION SPRINT
## Quick Path to Positive SPRS Score

**Target:** Improve from -129 to 0+ points in ONE WEEK  
**Method:** Documentation only (no technical changes required)  
**Effort:** 24-32 hours total

---

## THE STRATEGY

You already HAVE most controls implemented. You just need to:
1. Extract information from existing documents
2. Create simple 1-2 page policies
3. Document your credentials as evidence
4. Mark solopreneur items as N/A

**This is a documentation exercise, not a compliance project.**
